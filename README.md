# Wild_Beyond: A Multi-Modal and Multi-Sence Dataset For Ground Semantic Understanding
## Overview

## Dataset Discription
Wild -Beyond collects a total of more than 219K images,including 160K labelled images and 30K frames of semantically annotated images and point cloud,which contains real driving data at different times of the day, in different seasons, and in different regions.The data indicates that 33.3 per cent of frames (73,078) are paved, while 66.7 per cent (146,355) are off-road. These frames are divided into 26 different categories with the aim of analysing the impact of time of day, weather conditions, and terrain environments on performance, including scenarios such as night-time city, daytime desert, and evening beach.The primary terrain encompasses seven categories: desert, beach, gravel, paved, water, snow, and grass. In addition, the dataset encompasses fifteen types of targets including car, people, traffic sign, ship, etc.The size format of the recorded image files is 1024 x 768 pixels. Also Wild -Beyond contains synchronised vehicle underlay and point cloud data, at night we also use infrared camera for data acquisition work, these multimodal data will help to advance the development of driverless technology.
